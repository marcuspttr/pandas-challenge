# pandas-challenge
Working with Pandas strategize for the Heroes of Pymoli game and help the City schools with their finances.

Started up work at school this past week. Haven't been able to work on or update as much.
- Worked on both the PyCitySchools and HeroesOfPymoli problem sets.
- Got a rough work through on both; however, couldn't figure out how some of the Averages were being calculated for the HeroesOfPymoli sample.
- Cleaned up the formatting on the PyCitySchools, added basic #notes for clarity.
