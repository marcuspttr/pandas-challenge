# pandas-challenge
Working with Pandas strategize for the Heroes of Pymoli game and help the City schools with their finances.

Started up work at school (I'm a teacher) this past week. With the craziness of the first week I haven't been able to work on or update as much.
- Worked on both the PyCitySchools and HeroesOfPymoli problem sets.
- Got a rough work through on both; however, couldn't figure out how some of the Averages were being calculated for the HeroesOfPymoli sample.
- Cleaned up the formatting on the PyCitySchools, added basic #notes for clarity.
