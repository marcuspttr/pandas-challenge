# pandas-challenge
Working with Pandas strategize for the Heroes of Pymoli game and help the City schools with their finances.

Started up work at school (I'm a teacher) this past week. With the craziness of the first week I haven't been able to work on or update as much.
- Worked on both the PyCitySchools and HeroesOfPymoli problem sets.
- Got a rough work through on both; however, couldn't figure out how some of the Averages were being calculated for the HeroesOfPymoli sample.
- Had an initial commit last week and updated the README file, but these changes were overwritten? Possibly an error as I was modifying and pushing changes from multiple computers (home and work laptop)?
- Cleaned up the formatting on the PyCitySchools, added basic #notes for clarity.

Current outstanding issues:
- Some of the table outputs are not translating from Jupyter to the online preview.
- HeroesOfPymoli has a few incorrect calculations for Total Avg Purchase Per Person. Couldn't figure out what they were asking for here.
- Had another issue on HeroesOfPymoli when sorting for Most Profitable Item. After doing the sort, the column was correctly sorting the values. It was listing a middle value and then resorting mid-way. Ran out of time to figure out what was happening.

Analysis for PyCitySchools:
